# JDBC_Employee_Project
This project was made to strengthen my database management (SQL), Back-end (Java), and Cloud technology skills (AWS RDS and SG). Java database connectivity (JDBC) and CRUD as a whole. 

background: This project was built in my first semester, but recently, I refactored my code to make it easier to reuse major parts of the GUI code. I also implemented more features and deployed it onto AWS RDS too.

*NOTE* The GUI class can be optimized if I create a Panel class and apply the Encapsulation concept, where I create a blueprint class of panel objects so that I can reuse the common structure for mutiple panels. A deeper explanation can be found in the GUI.java file. 

The Management system is completely functional where users can:
  1. preform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on employee data

When I first created this project for a class final, it was basically spaghetti code (not very readable and hard to maintain). It was also hosted locally on my device on MySQL. When I started using Cloud services and got better at programming and understanding the importance of refactoring code and creating reusibility, I wanted to go back to this project and make it maintainable. I wanted to apply what I learned to this project and to get it to the point to where it is now.
