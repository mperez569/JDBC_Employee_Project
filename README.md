# JDBC_Employee_Project
This project was built in my first semester, but recently, I refactored my code to make it easier to reuse major parts of the GUI code. I also implemented more features and deployed it onto AWS RDS too.

*** The GUI class can be optimized if I create a Panel class and apply the Encapsulation concept, where I i create a blueprint class of panel objects and implement a feature
